BSides Oslo is an independent, community-driven inclusive information and cyber security conference. As a part of the global Security BSides network, the conference creates a space for members of the international and local information security communities to come together and share their knowledge and experiences. BSides Oslo is intended for anyone who works with, studies or has an interest in infosec.
