Security BSides Oslo is a non-profit event 100% executed by volunteers aiming to create the best conference for our community.

There is a lot that goes into executing an event like BSides, not only on the day of the event, but an on ongoing basis. There is a wide range of opportunities to contribute from more general tasks related to setup, registration, etc. on the day of the event to more specialized tasks that are required before/after the event or on an ongoing basis: sponsor management, social media management, media production, design, content, hosting a village, organizing a CTF, etc.

If you’d like to contribute and improve BSides Oslo from within, please fill out this short [Call for Volunteers](https://forms.gle/s6mjPBiSF6ieEcbm7) form to tell us a little bit about yourself and how you’d like to help.

What we can offer:

 * The experience of organizing and/or executing an established, radically accessible information security conference in the heart of Oslo for 250+ participants.
 * A swell bunch of fellow volunteers to work with.
 * The sense of impact and satisfication that comes with supporting your community.
 * A badge that says “organizer” on it.
 * First pick of pastries before the conference starts.
 * Coming up on the stage at the end of the conference.
